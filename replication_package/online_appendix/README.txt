Many of the tables and graphs use the same code with different parameter values. I provide the underlying model code, and explain which are used to create each table. The following tables are:

- Table 5-14; Figures 14-21:  Uses the model_run code. Each script creates the model output with a two week pretreatment window. Parameters can be changed.
  - Actual Oath Keepers recruitment not provided. Outcome in code is random normal variable.
  

Tables 17-19; Figures 23-32: Uses event_study_functions. Each script creates the summary statistics, TWFE, and event study results for each demographic variable.
